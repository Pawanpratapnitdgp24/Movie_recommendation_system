<h1>Movies Recommendation System</h1>
This repository contains the code and resources for a Movies Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences, which are inferred from a dataset of movies, user ratings, and other relevant data.

Project Workflow
Data Cleaning

Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and normalized data to ensure consistency.
Data Preprocessing

Transformed raw data into a format suitable for machine learning, including feature extraction and scaling.
Vectorization

Converted text data, such as movie titles and genres, into numerical vectors using methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model Training

Trained machine learning models to predict user preferences and recommend movies.
Evaluation

Assessed the performance of models using metrics like RMSE for rating predictions and precision/recall for recommendations.
